java cSS5302 Research Methods in Social SciencesSemester A 2024-25 
• Course Aims
This course aims to introduce basic research methods in social sciences, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and their application in social science issues. The course will cover research strategies and designs, practical issues in quantitative and qualitative methods, and research ethics and values.
Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to:
•	demonstrate a thorough understanding of qualitative and quantitative research methods in social sciences and their application in different research settings;
•	identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of different research methods in social research;
•	design a correlational study on a social science topic; and
•	comment critically on selected qualitative and quantitative studies.
• Teaching and Learning
The course contains lectures and data analysis exercises. You are expected to spend time digesting the lecture materials and working on research project (qualitative) and SPSS exercise (quantitative). You are encouraged to schedule individual or group consultation with the instructors on the progress of coursework, especially the research project and SPSS exercise. The course will be very useful for you to do rigorous qualitative and quantitative research in social sciences.
We will post announcements and lecture notes on the course webpage in Canvas (you can login to Canvas via https://canvas.cityu.edu.hk/login/ldap using your Electronic ID and Password). Most readings listed in this syllabus are reserved in our university library. Please finish the readings, including reading materials of the handouts, before class.

3)  SPSS Exercise (quantitative)  40%
100%
Deliverables:
•	Fieldwork Notes (qualitative, for the method of photovoice) (20%)
Fieldwork Notes include three parts: i) 3 photos, ii) 3 audial files for each photo (each audial file must at least last for 1.5 minutes), and iii) transcription of each audial file in word format (at the beginning of the transcription, you must give the following information: student no., gender, year of birth, place of birth, length of residence in Hong Kong, and name of the community (if appropriate). All these parts (photos+audial files+transcription word files) must be uploaded to Canvas. Any deviation from the above requirements will be conducive to mark loss.
Two research topics are allowed for taking photos: 
•	My experience of studying at City University of Hong Kong? 
•	My experience of living in my community?
•	Research Project (qualitative) (40%)
Students can freely organize among themselves. Students can conduct individual projects (1 student), or form. groups to conduct the research project (group size can range from 2 to 12). Research topics are provided in 1), and data can be obtained from Canvas in 1). The template for an “excellent” research project is Ho, Wing-Chung; Rochelle, Tina;  Yuen, Wing-Kan. (2011). “‘We are not sad at all’: Adolescents Talk about their ‘City of Sadness’ through Photovoice.” Journal of Adolescent Research, 26(6): 727-765. You can follow the link below or use Google scholar engine to find the paper.  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0743558410391255
The word limit of the research report is 10,000. 
Deadline for submitting Research Project: December 6 (11:59pm), 2024
Assignments must be submitted to Canvas no later than 11:59pm of the deadline day. Kindly note that the Department has a late submission policy (printed in the latest student Handbook). According to the rule, late submission for 1 day can be deducted by 1 sub-grade. For example, the penalty will be a deduction of 3 sub-grades for 3 days of late submission. Submission after 7 days after the deadline may be given a ‘0’ mark.
•	SPSS Exercise Assignments (40%)Each student needs to apply SPSS to compile a coherent and meaningful report due on Dec 8.  The report needs to apply 5 SPSS procedures taught in this course to address a research question based on a common dataset. This report needs to include a literature review section (20%), a method section (10%), results section (50%), and a discussion section (20%). Good description, justification, referencing, and formatting are necessary. The report will have 1,500 words in the main text, submitted in a single-line spacing Word file.
